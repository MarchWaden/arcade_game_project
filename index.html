    <div></br></br>This is a two player game. The objective is to score points by hitting the other player with lasers or bombs. Player 1 moves using the arrow keys, fires lasers using the enter key, lays bombs using \, and creates walls using ]. Player 2 uses WASD to move, fires with the spacebar, lays bombs with q, and creates walls with e. The walls at the edge of the gameboard are fully destructible and going "off-grid" is a feature, not a bug. When one bomb goes off, so will all the others across the whole screen. When bombs detonate they leave behind smoke which will obscure players. Lasers will “tunnel” through blocks directly in front of the player, allowing you to fire through walls. This was left in to reward players for successfully trapping an opponent. Zooming out using ctrl+- will prevent the window from scrolling up and down with the use of the arrow keys.</br>The purpose of this game is to showcase the fundamentals of html, css, and javascript, as well as bootstrap and jQuery.
