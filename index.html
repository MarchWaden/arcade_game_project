    <div></br></br>Player 1 moves using the arrow keys, fires lasers using the enter key, lays bombs using \, and creats walls using ]. Player 2 uses WASD to move, fires with the spacbar, lays bombs with q, and creates walls with e. The walls at the edge of the gameboard are fully desctructable, and going "off-grid" is a feature, not a bug. Laying a bomb resets the timers on all other bombs. Lasers also shoot through blocks directly in front of the squares. This was left in because it rewarded players for successfully trapping an opponent.</div>
